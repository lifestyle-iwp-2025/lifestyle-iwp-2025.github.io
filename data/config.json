          "content": "The cultural theory discussed in the paper is “Mindscape Theory”, proposed by Magoroh Maruyama, where he defines \". . . a structure of reasoning, cognition, perception, conceptualization, design, planning, and decision making that may vary from one individual, profession, culture, or social group to another“. The core tenets of Mindscape Theory include intracultural heterogeneity, transcultural heterogeneity and dominance of certain types. Mindscape Theory is proposed as a critique of the common assumption of intracultural homogeneity prevalent in many cross-cultural studies, particularly those following the framework of Hofstede, which explains how cultural values differ between countries by identifying six dimensions, such as individualism vs. collectivism and power distance. In high power distance cultures, \npeople tend to accept authority and hierarchy, so leaders are expected to make decisions without much input. In individualistic cultures, people value independence and personal achievement, \nwhile collectivist cultures emphasize group harmony and loyalty. The connection between mindscape theory and beauty is that aesthetic preferences are used as a way to capture and understand the different mindscape types within and between cultures.",

Many traditional cross cultural studies wrongly assume that members of a culture are largely homogeneous in their thinking and logic. This study provides empirical evidence for the existence of significant individual differences within cultures (intracultural heterogeneity). Additionally, the \"ugly\" to \"beautiful\" rating scale might be interpreted differently across cultures. The findings support ¹Maruyama's Mindscape Theory, which posits that individual differences in thinking and logic exist \nboth within and between cultures.",

In contrast, Mongolian women view fashion as a reflection of tradition and social norms, often shaped by cultural heritage.

In contrast, Mongolian fashion is more conservative, reflecting cultural tradition and social harmony.

Additionally, 23.4% of seniors in China use the internet, and leisure tends to be family-oriented and commonly takes place in community spaces. In contrast, in the United States, leisure is more focused on individual hobbies and physical activities like reading, going to the gym, or playing golf. There is also a strong emphasis on structured self-care and personal development, with greater value placed on independence than on community life."

This is evident in features such as en-suite bathrooms, individual bedrooms for each resident, and functional additions like utility rooms, garden sheds, and guest toilets. The home is viewed as a private retreat, with front gardens left open and visible, while the main garden at the back offers seclusion for residents. In contrast, Japanese homes emphasize family privacy and shared living, often featuring large, multi-purpose areas that combine kitchen, dining, and living spaces to promote warmth and togetherness. Gardens are designed for calm and atmosphere rather than activity, and houses are typically enclosed by fences to protect family privacy. Although the cultural focus remains on familial closeness, personal privacy has become more important in recent decades, as reflected in the growing adoption of Western-style bedrooms—from just 17% in the 1970s to 66% by the 1990s.",

On the qualitative side, structured interviews were conducted with 56 homeowners in England and 55 in Japan. These interviews included four key open-ended questions, addressing topics such as the ideal home and individual preferences or dislikes. The responses were systematically coded into 20 thematic categories, including privacy, space, family, and aesthetics.",
